# Backend for ng-food-review-fe
Hello! This app will allow my partner and I to upload photos (of food duh) to then write a review so that **__in future__** we are reminded of what's good and what's not.

If pulling this repo, make sure to create a .env file with the variables and fill them out accordingly (mysql):
- DB_HOST
- DB_USER
- DB_PASSWORD
- DB_NAME
